### Sending error reports to Danol
* Please first read the troubleshooting [https://github.com/CZDanol/StreamDeck-DiscordVolumeMixer2#common-problems](here) and try to resolve problem on your own.
* Open `%appdata%/Elgato/StreamDeck/Plugins/cz.danol.discordmixer.sdPlugin/` in file explorer.
* Create `clog.txt` in the directory. Those can be just empty files.
  * Make sure you don't create `clog.txt.txt` instead.
* Repeat the task causing you the problem with my plugin (for example pressing the volume mixer button).
* Send me the `clog.txt` in PM on Discord ([Stream Deck Labs Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/294BQE6Xdp), Danol#2663).
* Delete the `clog.txt` file afterwards, or it will keep growing.
