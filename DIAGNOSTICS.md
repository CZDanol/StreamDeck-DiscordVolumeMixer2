### Sending error reports to Danol
* Open `%appdata%/Elgato/StreamDeck/Plugins/cz.danol.discordmixer.sdPlugin/` in file explorer.
* Create `log.txt` and `clog.txt` in the directory. Those can be just empty files.
* Repeat the task causing you the problem with my plugin (for example pressing the volume mixer button).
* Send me the `log.txt`, `clog.txt` and `%appdata%/Elgato/StreamDeck/logs/StreamDeck0.log` in PM on Discord ([Stream Deck Labs Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/294BQE6Xdp), Danol#2663).
